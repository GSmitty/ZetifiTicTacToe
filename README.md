# ZetifiTicTacToe

### This is the repository for the Python coding challenge given by Zetifi. All of the implementation details for the TicTacToe class are in TicTacToe.py, and all of the created unit tests are in TicTacTests.py. The created yml file for the GitHub Actions is in the github folder. I have done some quick runs of the workflow for testing purposes.
